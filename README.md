### Open-Source Lost-and-Found Management for Disc Golf

OLaF is a free and open-source lost-and-found management app for disc golf courses and leagues. It allows lost-and-found managers to track their disc inventory, automatically notify disc owners, and manage disc pickup deadlines.

In the future, we plan to implement player-facing features to allow disc owners to see their found discs awaiting pickup and their history of returned discs.
